# SVG-Logo-Maker

## User Story
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered

## Description
My motivation for this project was to take what I learned from class and apply it in this challenge to make a logo generator. I built this project to show that I have an understanding of npm packages, such as inquirer. Also, that I can write tests on my code to make sure that it works, by using jest. I also have shown that I have a good grasp on object oriented programming by being able to use classes that have inheritance, polymorphism and more within them. This problem solves being able to prompt a user with questions so that they can generate a simple logo easily.

After all of that, the user can enter npm run test in the integrated terminal in order to see that the shapes tests all work.
